# SaaS Tutorial

## Following along with [Jon Meyers](https://jonmeyers.io/blog/tech-stack-and-initial-project-setup).

This is a project built by following along with Jon Meyers's tutorial to build a SaaS service. In this case, he is building Courses, a "video tutorial/course platform that contains a collection of free and paid courses."

I will likely change some essential pieces along the way as proofs to myself that I understand what is going on.
